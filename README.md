AME SCANNER: THE KINETIC PROBE
THE PHILOSOPHY
The physical world is not a collection of pixels; it is a convergence of density, intent, and structural logic. Traditional 3D reconstruction treats environments as hollow shells. AME Scanner treats them as raw, unorganized matter awaiting a system.

This repository hosts the autonomous sensory organ of the AMAR Engine (AME). The Scanner does not "model" scenes. It invades them. It traverses Gaussian Splatting (GS) radiance fields, identifies density gradients, and establishes the initial geometric anchors (Proxy Boxes) required for the AME Admin to perform Metaclass binding.

THE ARCHITECTURE
The Scanner operates on a Late-Binding Semantic architecture. It is intentionally blind to object identity. Its sole purpose is the extraction of spatial truth from chaotic field data.

1. Field Traversal
The probe navigates the 3D radiance field using a density-weighted sampling algorithm. It ignores transient noise and floating artifacts, focusing on the core volumetric mass of real-world entities.

2. Primitive Encapsulation
Upon detecting a structural cluster, the Scanner calculates the minimal bounding volume. It generates a temporary AEID-Alpha and a localized feature hash. This is the "Primitive State"—the moment before a thing becomes a Thing.

3. Admin Handshake
The Scanner transmits a structured payload to the AME Admin. It provides the coordinates, the volume, and the visual signature. It waits for the Admin to return a Metaclass instruction.

TECHNICAL CHALLENGES
We are not looking for generalists. We are looking for those who understand the intersection of:

Radiance Field Deconstruction: Moving beyond visualization into structural analysis of 3DGS.

Spatial Adjacency Logic: Determining where one object ends and the environment begins without human labeling.

Kinetic Probing: Developing agents that can "touch" a digital field to verify solidity and mass.

THE WORKFLOW
INPUT: Raw Gaussian Splatting data.

PROBE: High-speed density cluster detection.

ANCHOR: Generation of localized Proxy Boxes.

EMIT: Exporting structural JSON payloads to AME Admin for Metaclass injection.

JOIN THE REVOLUTION
If you believe that the Metaverse is currently a graveyard of dead meshes, help us build the tools that bring it to life. We are replacing static polygons with dynamic systems.

The AME Admin is the brain. The Scanner is the hand.
