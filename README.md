# AME SCANNER: THE KINETIC PROBE

## THE PHILOSOPHY

The physical world is not a collection of pixels; it is a convergence of **density**, **intent**, and **structural logic**.  

Traditional 3D reconstruction treats environments as hollow shells.  
**AME Scanner** treats them as raw, unorganized matter—awaiting a system.

This repository hosts the **autonomous sensory organ** of the **AMAR Engine (AME)**.  
The Scanner does not "model" scenes. It **invades** them.  

It traverses **Gaussian Splatting (GS) radiance fields**, identifies **density gradients**, and establishes the initial **geometric anchors** (*Proxy Boxes*) required for the **AME Admin** to perform **Metaclass binding**.

## THE ARCHITECTURE

The Scanner operates on a **Late-Binding Semantic architecture**.  
It is intentionally blind to object identity. Its sole purpose:  
> **Extract spatial truth from chaotic field data.**

### 1. Field Traversal  
The probe navigates the 3D radiance field using a **density-weighted sampling algorithm**.  
It ignores transient noise and floating artifacts, focusing exclusively on the **core volumetric mass** of real-world entities.

### 2. Primitive Encapsulation  
Upon detecting a structural cluster, the Scanner:  
- Calculates the **minimal bounding volume**,  
- Generates a temporary **AEID-Alpha**,  
- Produces a **localized feature hash**.  

This state—before a thing becomes a *Thing*—is called the **Primitive State**.

### 3. Admin Handshake  
The Scanner transmits a structured payload to the **AME Admin**, including:  
- Spatial coordinates,  
- Bounding volume,  
- Visual signature.  

It then awaits a **Metaclass instruction** in return.

## TECHNICAL CHALLENGES

We are not looking for generalists.  
We seek those who understand the intersection of:

- **Radiance Field Deconstruction**: Moving beyond visualization into *structural analysis* of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS).  
- **Spatial Adjacency Logic**: Determining where one object ends and the environment begins—**without human labeling**.  
- **Kinetic Probing**: Developing agents that can "**touch**" a digital field to verify **solidity** and **mass**.

## THE WORKFLOW

| Stage   | Action |
|--------|--------|
| **INPUT**  | Raw Gaussian Splatting data |
| **PROBE**  | High-speed density cluster detection |
| **ANCHOR** | Generation of localized Proxy Boxes |
| **EMIT**   | Export structural JSON payloads to AME Admin for Metaclass injection |

## JOIN THE REVOLUTION

> If you believe the Metaverse is currently a **graveyard of dead meshes**, help us build the tools that bring it to life.

We are replacing **static polygons** with **dynamic systems**.

- The **AME Admin** is the brain.  
- The **Scanner** is the hand.

## EXPORT OPTIONS

AME offers two export options:

1. **oasisdomain (osdm)** - The primary and most common export format for interactive worlds. Note that osdm is not a file format but a folder structure specification.

2. **eme world (emewd)** - A special single-file export format that is part of the eme project (another of our initiatives, a radical AI project where AI agents learn like human infants). This feature is not included by default and must be downloaded as a plugin. The eme world can exist without a 3D scene for human display.

## METACLASS SUPPLEMENT

1. Each metaclass has its own independent parameter list
2. Metaclasses will be continuously updated (both in quantity and individual parameters)
3. The overall trend is from concrete to abstract, as metaclasses evolve from real-world origins to increasingly self-consistent systems
4. Metaclasses can be divided into two main categories:
   a. **Root Metaclasses**: Such as smoothness, space (these can also serve as parameters for standard metaclasses)
   b. **Standard Metaclasses**: Containers, wheels, liquids, etc. (grass and water are examples of their objects; root metaclasses have no objects, which is the fundamental difference)
5. A metaclass can have multiple representations (e.g., space can be represented in Cartesian coordinates or from a sensory perspective); each representation is called a "room"
