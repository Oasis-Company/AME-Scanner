# AME SCANNER: THE KINETIC PROBE

## THE PHILOSOPHY

The physical world is not a collection of pixels; it is a convergence of **density**, **intent**, and **structural logic**.  

Traditional 3D reconstruction treats environments as hollow shells.  
**AME Scanner** treats them as raw, unorganized matter—awaiting a system.

This repository hosts the **autonomous sensory organ** of the **AMAR Engine (AME)**.  
The Scanner does not "model" scenes. It **invades** them.  

It traverses **Gaussian Splatting (GS) radiance fields**, identifies **density gradients**, and establishes the initial **geometric anchors** (*Proxy Boxes*) required for the **AME Admin** to perform **Metaclass binding**.

## THE ARCHITECTURE

The Scanner operates on a **Late-Binding Semantic architecture**.  
It is intentionally blind to object identity. Its sole purpose:  
> **Extract spatial truth from chaotic field data.**

### 1. Field Traversal  
The probe navigates the 3D radiance field using a **density-weighted sampling algorithm**.  
It ignores transient noise and floating artifacts, focusing exclusively on the **core volumetric mass** of real-world entities.

### 2. Primitive Encapsulation  
Upon detecting a structural cluster, the Scanner:  
- Calculates the **minimal bounding volume**,  
- Generates a temporary **AEID-Alpha**,  
- Produces a **localized feature hash**.  

This state—before a thing becomes a *Thing*—is called the **Primitive State**.

### 3. Admin Handshake  
The Scanner transmits a structured payload to the **AME Admin**, including:  
- Spatial coordinates,  
- Bounding volume,  
- Visual signature.  

It then awaits a **Metaclass instruction** in return.

## TECHNICAL CHALLENGES

We are not looking for generalists.  
We seek those who understand the intersection of:

- **Radiance Field Deconstruction**: Moving beyond visualization into *structural analysis* of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS).  
- **Spatial Adjacency Logic**: Determining where one object ends and the environment begins—**without human labeling**.  
- **Kinetic Probing**: Developing agents that can "**touch**" a digital field to verify **solidity** and **mass**.

## THE WORKFLOW

| Stage   | Action |
|--------|--------|
| **INPUT**  | Raw Gaussian Splatting data |
| **PROBE**  | High-speed density cluster detection |
| **ANCHOR** | Generation of localized Proxy Boxes |
| **EMIT**   | Export structural JSON payloads to AME Admin for Metaclass injection |

## JOIN THE REVOLUTION

> If you believe the Metaverse is currently a **graveyard of dead meshes**, help us build the tools that bring it to life.

We are replacing **static polygons** with **dynamic systems**.

- The **AME Admin** is the brain.  
- The **Scanner** is the hand.
